- content: 2022). She is a member of the Research and Innovation in Software Engineering
    (RISE) Research Group of the department since 2016. She teaches programming and
    software design courses at the undergraduate level, ranging from Object-Oriented
    Programming (C++, Java), Data Structure (Java), Concept of Programming Languages,
    Advanced Programming (C#, .NET), Algorithm Analysis and Design, Software Architecture
    and Design Paradigms, Software Modelling, to Design Patterns. At the postgraduate
    level, she teaches/had taught Software Engineering courses such as Architecting
    Software Systems/Software Architecture, Software Metrics, and Software Engineering
    Process and Practice. Her research expertise lies in software architecture knowledge
    management, software architecture documentation, software architecture information
    seeking, chunking and foraging; empirical software engineering; object-oriented
    design, design patterns; web services, end-user web services composition, end-user
    software development; mining software repositories, Application Programming Interface
    (API) recommenders; CASE tool (programming environment); virtual reality for the
    Internet. She is interested in many aspects of software design (including software
    architecture), which include capturing and representing generic and project-specific
    software design knowledge and design intent, supporting efficient and effective
    retrieval and usage of this knowledge to assist software designers and end-users
    in producing good software design that factors in modularity, modifiability, reusability,
    extensibility, evolvability and adaptability to cater for increasingly complex
    software systems. Her ultimate goals are to support Do-It-Yourself (or end-user
    software development) as well as automated software design, development and evolution,
    and apprenticeship in software design. Her latest research also includes the design
    and development of ethical software, and software engineering aspects of robotics.
