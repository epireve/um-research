# Documentation Update Recommendations

After reviewing the documentation for the UM Research Supervisor Profile Enrichment project, here are recommended updates to ensure documentation accurately reflects the current state of the project.

## Repository Structure Documentation

The `repository_structure.md` file contains two different directory structures:
1. A detailed structure with explanations for directories like `src/`, `data/`, `scripts/`, etc.
2. A top-level organization that appears to be the actual current structure with `profiles/`, `gemini_prompts/`, etc.

**Recommendation:** Consolidate these structures into a single, accurate representation of the current repository and remove the outdated structure. The current structure appears to be:

```
.
├── data/                 # Raw and processed data
├── docs/                 # Documentation files
├── gemini_prompts/       # Prompts for Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
├── profiles/             # Processed YAML profiles
├── project_plan.md       # Project plan and roadmap
├── scripts/              # Scripts for data processing
└── [other files]         # Other configuration and readme files
```

## Schema Documentation Updates

The `profile_schema.md` document provides a detailed schema for supervisor profiles, but it should be verified that it matches the actual profiles being used in the system.

**Recommendation:** Cross-check the schema documentation with current profiles to ensure all fields are accurately described, especially given the recent profile merging efforts.

## Guides Directory Expansion

Currently, the `docs/guides/` directory only contains a `GEMINI_INTEGRATION.md` file.

**Recommendation:** Create additional guide documents:
1. `data_access.md` - How to access and query the profile data
2. `contribution_guide.md` - How to contribute to the project
3. `development_setup.md` - Setting up the development environment
4. `profile_editing.md` - Guidelines for editing and updating profiles

## Methodology Documentation Update

The `methodology.md` file provides a good overview of the process, but it could be enhanced with:

**Recommendation:**
1. Add specific details about the profile merging process that has been recently conducted
2. Include more concrete examples of how data is extracted and merged
3. Add references to the tools used in the actual implementation (scripts, etc.)
4. Update the section on AI-Assisted Merging with examples of actual prompts used

## Summary Document Enhancement

The `summary.md` document appears to describe an implementation that uses paths like `data/profiles/` when the actual paths in use are just `profiles/`.

**Recommendation:** Update the file paths and directory references to match the current repository structure.

## Project Plan Alignment

The `project_plan.md` file outlines many completed tasks, but there may be newly completed tasks that aren't reflected.

**Recommendation:** Update the project plan to:
1. Mark recently completed profile merging tasks
2. Update timelines to reflect current progress
3. Adjust immediate priorities based on recent work

## New Documentation Needs

**Recommendation:** Create new documentation:
1. `profile_merging_process.md` - Detailed explanation of the profile merging process with examples
2. `ai_prompt_templates.md` - Templates and examples of prompts used with Gemini
3. `data_sources.md` - Comprehensive list of data sources used for each profile
4. `profile_completeness.md` - Metrics on profile completeness and areas for improvement

## Documentation Style Standardization

The documentation files use slightly different formats and levels of detail.

**Recommendation:** Standardize documentation style:
1. Ensure consistent Markdown formatting across all files
2. Use consistent terminology for key concepts
3. Implement standard headers and sections in related documents
4. Add dates of last update to all documentation files

## Implementation Priority

Suggested order of implementation for these updates:
1. Repository structure clarification
2. Project plan alignment
3. Methodology updates
4. New documentation needs
5. Schema documentation updates
6. Guides expansion
7. Summary document enhancement
8. Style standardization
