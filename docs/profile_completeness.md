# Profile Completeness Metrics

This document tracks the completeness of supervisor profiles in the Research Supervisor Matching project and identifies areas for improvement.

## Overview

Profile completeness is critical for the effectiveness of the matching system. The more complete a profile, the better the matching algorithm can identify relevant supervisors for students based on their research interests and academic goals.

## Completeness Categories

We measure completeness across several categories:

| Category | Description | Weight |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Basic Information | Name, position, department, university | 20% |
| Contact Information | Email, office, phone, website | 15% |
| Academic Background | Degrees, institutions, years | 15% |
| Research Information | Research interests, expertise | 20% |
| Publications | Journal articles, conference papers, etc. | 20% |
| Additional Information | Projects, supervised students, roles | 10% |

## Current Status

As of [Current Date], the overall completeness of supervisor profiles is as follows:

| Completeness Level | Number of Profiles | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Complete (90-100%) | 4 | 36% |
| High (75-89%) | 5 | 45% |
| Medium (50-74%) | 2 | 19% |
| Low (<50%) | 0 | 0% |

### Profile-specific Completeness

| tkchiew | 92% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 90% | 90% | 70% | Limited project information |
| nazean | 88% | 100% | 100% | 90% | 95% | 85% | 55% | Few supervised students listed |
| hazimhanif | 85% | 100% | 90% | 100% | 80% | 90% | 50% | Missing project details |
| smting | 85% | 100% | 80% | 90% | 95% | 85% | 60% | Limited professional memberships |
| asmiza | 78% | 100% | 80% | 90% | 75% | 70% | 55% | Publications may be incomplete |
| adeleh | 75% | 100% | 75% | 80% | 80% | 70% | 45% | Few supervised students, limited roles |
| hazrina | 72% | 100% | 70% | 90% | 75% | 65% | 30% | Missing additional information |
| rjry | 70% | 100% | 85% | 70% | 75% | 60% | 30% | Incomplete publication records |
| hema | 65% | 100% | 60% | 75% | 70% | 55% | 30% | Missing multiple sections |
| mumtaz | 60% | 100% | 60% | 75% | 65% | 50% | 10% | Several incomplete sections |

## Common Gaps

The following areas have been identified as common gaps across multiple profiles:

1. **Supervised Students**: Many profiles have incomplete information about supervised students (75% of profiles)
2. **Project Details**: Project information is often limited or missing (60% of profiles)
3. **Professional Memberships**: Information about professional memberships is often incomplete (70% of profiles)
4. **Older Publications**: Some profiles may be missing older publications that aren't available in digital databases (40% of profiles)
5. **Contact Details**: Some profiles have incomplete contact information, particularly office locations and phone numbers (30% of profiles)

## Improvement Plan

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks)

1. **Fill Critical Gaps**: Complete basic and contact information for all profiles
   - Responsible: Data Collection Team
   - Priority: High

2. **Publication Verification**: Cross-reference publication lists with academic databases (Scopus, Google Scholar)
   - Responsible: Data Verification Team
   - Priority: High

3. **Research Interests Standardization**: Ensure research interests use consistent terminology
   - Responsible: Data Standardization Team
   - Priority: Medium

### Medium-term Actions (3-4 weeks)

1. **Academic Background Enrichment**: Add missing degree information and thesis titles
   - Responsible: Data Enrichment Team
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Project Information**: Gather additional information about research projects
   - Responsible: Data Collection Team
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Roles and Memberships**: Complete information about academic roles and professional memberships
   - Responsible: Data Verification Team
   - Priority: Low

### Long-term Actions (2-3 months)

1. **Supervised Students**: Compile comprehensive lists of supervised students
   - Responsible: Data Collection Team
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Automated Updates**: Develop processes for regular updates from academic databases
   - Responsible: Development Team
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Profile Maintenance Plan**: Establish a system for regular profile reviews and updates
   - Responsible: Project Management
   - Priority: High

## Data Sources for Improvement

The following sources can be used to improve profile completeness:

1. **Departmental Websites**: For updated roles and contact information
2. **Academic Databases**: Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar for publications
3. **University Repositories**: For theses supervised and projects
4. **Professional Organization Websites**: For memberships and roles
5. **Conference Websites**: For recent presentations and publications
6. **Direct Outreach**: Contact supervisors to verify and complete their profiles

## Impact of Profile Completeness

Improving profile completeness is expected to have the following impacts:

1. **Matching Accuracy**: More complete profiles lead to better student-supervisor matches
2. **User Satisfaction**: Students can make more informed decisions with complete information
3. **Supervisor Engagement**: Supervisors with complete profiles are more likely to be contacted by appropriate students
4. **System Utility**: The overall usefulness of the system increases with data completeness

## Tracking Methodology

Profile completeness is tracked through the following process:

1. **Regular Audits**: Monthly audits of profile completeness
2. **Automated Checks**: Script-based validation against the schema
3. **Completeness Metrics**: Calculated based on field presence and quality
4. **Progress Tracking**: Changes in completeness metrics over time
5. **Gap Analysis**: Identification of systematic gaps across profiles

## Next Steps

1. Develop an automated profile completeness checking script
2. Prioritize profiles for improvement based on completeness scores
3. Create a dashboard for visualizing profile completeness metrics
4. Establish a regular schedule for profile completeness reviews

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made in enriching supervisor profiles, there are still areas for improvement. Focusing on the identified gaps and following the improvement plan will enhance the quality and completeness of profiles, ultimately leading to better matching results for students seeking research supervisors.
